## InputX
LaTeX package [by Blackstev](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/44215) (2011/06/28) for better file includings.

> Command `\inputpaths` specifies the directories where `\include` and `\input` can look for the given file.  
> The latter use the root directory whilst input paths are not set.

**Usage:**&emsp;`\inputpaths {dir1, ..., dirN}`


## IUnits

> Provides a plenty of physical units and prefixes' macros.  
> See the package content for help since it is rather self-descriptive.

**Usage:**&emsp;`Ускорение свободно падающего тела $ g = 9.8~\m/\s^2 $.`
